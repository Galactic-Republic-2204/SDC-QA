# System Design - RESTful API for Q&A

•	Reduced latency from 10s to 300ms by identifying database bottlenecks and strategically refining the queries
•	Performed horizontal scaling by setting up five AWS EC2 servers under a load balancer to meet the high request traffic
•	Achieved a 10ms average response time and 0 error rate by under a 1000 requests per second stress test scenario with loader.io to meet the requirement for supporting the website traffic
